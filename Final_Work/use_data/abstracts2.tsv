39474560	This report presents a case of an exceptionally delayed distant recurrence of a choroidal melanoma, occurring 4 decades after the enucleation of the affected eye.In 1977, a 29-year-old man underwent enucleation for a choroidal melanoma. At the age of 68 years, he was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. Although the metastatic prostate cancer responded to treatment, a persistent lung lesion warranted further examination. A lung biopsy, somewhat surprisingly, confirmed the presence of melanoma metastasis, 4 decades after the enucleation. The cells were positive for Melan-A, while no The recurrence of a choroidal melanoma is substantiated by the histopathological and molecular analyses, including the finding of a 
39473410	Chromosomal rearrangements and recurrent gene fusions were previously presumed to be the primary oncogenic mechanisms of hematological malignancies. However, the discovery of gene fusions in different cancers has opened new horizons to comprehensively investigate how cell type-specific fusion oncoproteins modulate signaling cascades. Prostate cancer (PCa) is a multifaceted and therapeutically challenging disease, and functional genomics have helped us develop a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying prostate carcinogenesis, castration-resistant PCa, and metastasis. Keeping in mind the fact that gene fusions have also been discovered in PCa, there has been rapid expansion in the field of molecular oncology and researchers are uncovering new facets regarding the mechanistic regulation of signaling pathways by fusion oncoproteins.
39473059	Approximately 15% of patients with localized prostate cancer are at high risk for disease recurrence. Many clinical trials have evaluated the impact of neoadjuvant therapy before radical prostatectomy with mixed results (NCT00321698).This phase I/II clinical trial evaluated the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of neoadjuvant radiation therapy and docetaxel before prostatectomy in 25 men with high-risk prostate cancer. The treatment regimen included 45 Gy radiotherapy in 25 fractions to the prostate and seminal vesicles over 5 weeks, along with weekly dose-escalated docetaxel up to 30 mg/m², followed by prostatectomy and bilateral lymph node dissection. The primary endpoint was the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR). Secondary endpoints included adverse events, symptom and quality of life measures, and prostate-specific antigen metrics.All 25 patients completed the planned treatment. The primary endpoint of pCR was not achieved. Lymphopenia was the most common grade 3 or higher toxicity, with no grade 3 or higher genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicities observed. With a median follow-up of 11.6 years, the 10-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was 60%, and distant metastasis-free survival was 80%. Prostate cancer-specific survival and overall survival at 10 years were 84% and 60%, respectively.Although pCR was not met, the treatment demonstrated a modest toxicity profile and reasonable long-term outcomes, suggesting feasibility and safety. Further studies are needed to optimize endpoints and assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatments compared with standard approaches in high-risk prostate cancer patients.
39472200	Lymph node dissection (LND) has been standard in cancer surgery for more than a century, yet evidence from randomized trials showing a benefit is scarce. We conducted a clinically integrated randomized trial comparing limited versus extended pelvic LND (PLND) during radical prostatectomy and previously reported comparable biochemical recurrence (BCR) rates. We report updated BCR rates and compare rates of metastasis between the study arms.Between October 2011 and March 2017, 1432 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were enrolled at a single center. Surgeons were cluster randomized to perform limited (external iliac nodes) or extended PLND (external iliac, obturator, and hypogastric nodes) with crossover for 3-mo periods. Cox proportional-hazards regression with robust standard errors clustered by surgeon was used to assess whether the PLND template affected BCR or distant or locoregional metastasis.There were 452 BCR events at median follow-up of 4.2 yr for participants who did not develop BCR. The results confirm our previous finding of comparable BCR rates between the arms (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-1.13; p = 0.3). However, with 123 metastasis events and median follow-up of 5.4 yr for patients without metastasis, we found a clinically and statistically significant protective effect of extended PLND against metastasis (any metastasis: HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.93; p = 0.003; distant metastasis: HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64-0.88; p < 0.001).Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy should receive extended PLND that includes the external iliac, obturator, and hypogastric nodes. Further research should examine biological mechanisms regarding the anatomic location of affected nodes. Trials of LND for other cancers are warranted and should consider our clinically integrated design. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01407263.
39470422	Background An artificial intelligence (AI)-based method for measuring intraprostatic tumor volume based on data from MRI may provide prognostic information. Purpose To evaluate whether the total volume of intraprostatic tumor from AI-generated segmentations (V
39468217	Focal Therapy (FT) is a treatment option for the treatment of limited volume clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). We aim to systematically review outcomes of established FT modalities to assess the contemporary baseline and identify gaps in evidence that will aid in further trial and study design.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all primary studies reporting outcomes of FT using cryotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), and irreversible electroporation (IRE). We described patient inclusion criteria, selection tools, treatment parameters, and surveillance protocols, and pooled overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), biochemical progression (BP), biopsy, secondary treatment, sexual, and urinary function outcomes. Composite failure was defined as salvage whole gland ablation, radical treatment, hormonal therapy or transition to watchful waiting.We identified 49 unique cohorts of men undergoing FT between 2008 and 2024 (21 cryotherapy, 20 HIFU, and 8 IRE). Median follow-up ranged from 6 to 63 months. Pooled OS was 98.0%, CSS 99.3%, and MFS 98.5%. Pooled BP was 9.4%/year. Biopsy was mandated post-FT within 24 months in 36/49 (73.5%) cohorts, with pooled csPCa (GG ≥ 2) rates of 22.2% overall, 8.9% infield, and 12.3% outfield. The pooled rate of secondary FT was 5.0%, radical treatment 10.5%, and composite failure 14.1%. Of 35 studies reporting sexual function, 45.7% reported a low, 48.6% moderate, and 5.7% severe impact. For 34 cohorts reporting urinary function, 97.1% reported a low impact. No differences were noted between cryotherapy, HIFU, or IRE in any of the outcomes.FT with cryotherapy, HIFU, and IRE is associated with good short-intermediate term oncological and functional outcomes. However, outcome reporting is heterogeneous and often incomplete. Long-term follow-up and standardized reporting are required to better define and report FT outcomes.
39467994	Androgen-receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) become the new standard of care for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). It is unknown whether time to castration resistance (TTCR), when using the first-line ARSIs, offers predictive value in mHSPC. We sought to assess the clinical outcomes for mHSPC patients treated with first-line ARSIs focusing on the TTCR.Data from the ULTRA-Japan study cohort from five academic institutes (496 mHSPC patients) were retrospectively analyzed.The median overall survival (OS) in the total cohort was 80 months with a median follow-up of 18 months. Of 496 patients, 332 (67%), 82 (16.5%), and 82 (16.5%) were treated with first-line abiraterone acetate + prednisone, enzalutamide, and apalutamide, respectively. During the follow-up, a total of 155 (31%) were diagnosed with mCRPC with a median TTCR of 10 months. In those 155 patients, TTCR > 12 months is an independent predictor of longer OS from the first-line ARSIs. Cox regression analysis of the TTCR from initiating first-line ARSI in 496 mHSPC patients revealed three variables as independent predictors of shorter TTCR, including Gleason's score (GS) ≥ 9, the extent of disease (EOD) ≥ 2, and the presence of liver metastasis.Our results indicate that mHSPC patients with those three features are likely to have primary resistance to first-line ARSIs (doublet therapy), thus requiring consideration of other options, such as the recent triplet approach.
39466634	Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer usually have lymph nodes and bone metastasis. We present a rare case of a 51-year-old patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who complained of left truncated sciatica and diffuse bone pain and who was referred for 177Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) screening. Pretreatment 68Ga-PSMA showed left sciatic nerve and multiple bone uptake. Patient underwent stereotactic radiotherapy on the sciatic nerve metastasis (30 Gy in 6 fractions of 5 Gy) before 7.4 GBq of 177Lu-PSMA infusions. Left truncated sciatica disappeared after stereotactic radiotherapy. No additional toxicity was added to the sciatic nerve from 177Lu-PSMA after stereotactic radiotherapy.
39465866	Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has a poor prognosis especially when harboring DNA damage repair gene mutations, nevertheless, in the case of pathogenic BRCA gene mutations, PARPi demonstrated a survival benefit and is a validated treatment. Nowadays, there is no data regarding unusual metastases after these drugs. Cutaneous metastases appear rarely in prostate cancer and were associated with a worse prognosis. Moreover, there are no consolidated data concerning skin tropism of prostate cancer cells, neither in the case of BRCA-associated cancers.Here, we report the case of a patient with a long history of BRCA1-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who developed a skin lesion on the scalp while on his fifth line of systemic therapy with olaparib. After a complete radical surgical excision, the pathology report showed prostate cancer localization.A diagnosis of skin metastasis from prostate cancer was reported.The patient then continued olaparib therapy; after 7 months from excision, he experienced further bone and biochemical progression but not cutaneous progression.A literature review of all reported cases of cutaneous metastasis in prostate cancer was conducted to shed light on the incidence, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of this entity. We also reviewed published cases of skin metastasis in BRCA-associated cancers with an effort to correlate skin involvement with PARPi treatment, BRCAness status, and prognosis.
39465761	In this prospective observational study, our objective was to investigate the serum levels of Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) in prostate cancer (PCa) patients and examine its association with other serum biomarkers, and the clinical outcomes of PCa patients. This prospective observational study was conducted from January 2019 to October 2021, including 103 cases of PCa patients and 101 cases of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients who received treatment at our hospital. All patients had their serum ACSL4 levels measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before treatment. The clinical outcomes included age, body mass index, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, tumor node metastasis stage, Gleason scores, and prostate volume and serum biomarkers were collected. All patients were followed up for 36 months, the overall survival and disease-free survival were recorded for all patients. All data used SPSS 26.0 for analysis. The phosphorus (P) and serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher in PCa patients compared to BPH patients. Furthermore, compared to the BPH patients, the serum ACSL4 and free prostate-specific antigen levels were significantly decreased while serum total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) levels were significantly elevated in PCa patients. Pearson correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between ACSL4 levels and free prostate-specific antigen levels, while a negative correlation was observed with P and tPSA levels. ACSL4 might serve as a biomarker for diagnosing PCa with the AUC was 0.747, cutoff value of 33.68 ng/mL, sensitivity of 70.3%, and specificity of 60.2%. Finally, we found that ACSL4, tPSA, and P were identified as risk factors associated with PCa patients. Our findings indicated that the serum levels of ACSL4 were significantly decreased in PCa patients compared to BPH patients. Serum ACSL4 could be used as a potential biomarker for early PCa diagnosis and prognosis.
39464080	Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progresses despite androgen deprivation therapy, as cancer cells adapt to grow without testosterone, becoming more aggressive and prone to metastasis. CRPC biology complicates the development of effective therapies, posing challenges for patient care. Recent gene-expression and metabolomics studies highlight the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) as a critical player, with key components like GNPNAT1 and UAP1 being downregulated in metastatic CRPC. GNPNAT1 knockdown has been shown to increase cell proliferation and metastasis in CRPC cell lines, though the mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate the cellular basis of these CRPC phenotypes, we generated a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout model of GNPNAT1 in 22Rv1 CRPC cells, analyzing its impact on metabolomic, glycoproteomic, and transcriptomic profiles of cells. We hypothesize that HBP inhibition disrupts the cytoskeleton, altering mitotic progression and promoting uncontrolled growth. GNPNAT1 KO cells showed reduced levels of cytoskeletal filaments, such as actin and microtubules, leading to cell structure disorganization and chromosomal mis-segregation. GNPNAT1 inhibition also activated PI3K/AKT signaling, promoting proliferation, and impaired cell adhesion by mislocalizing EphB6, enhancing migration via the RhoA pathway and promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These findings suggest that HBP plays a critical role in regulating CRPC cell behavior, and targeting this pathway could provide a novel therapeutic approach.
39463621	Angiosarcoma of the bone is very rare, accounting for less than 1% of all malignant bone tumors. We report our experience with an epithelioid hemangiosarcoma arising in the proximal tibia and a review of the literature. The patient, an 85-year-old male, was referred to our institution because of left knee pain that had persisted for five months, and bone radiolucency was observed in the proximal tibia. A bone and prostate biopsy was performed due to a suspicion of prostate cancer and bone metastasis. The positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) showed accumulation in the prostate and proximal tibia, and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was high at 14.11 ng/mL. Therefore, we diagnosed the patient with bone metastasis of prostate cancer and performed curettage and cement filling. However, postoperative pathological diagnosis revealed an epithelioid hemangiosarcoma, and we considered amputation. Two months after curettage, the patient underwent transfemoral amputation because of local recurrence. Eight months after amputation, he died due to multiple metastases. Approximately 20% of cases with epithelioid hemangiosarcoma have multiple metastases at the time of initial diagnosis, and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish from bone metastases of cancer because they may be arranged in foci or on cords. There are few reports of effective adjuvant therapy, and the clinical course can be rapid, so early amputation should be considered.
39462742	For patients with low-volume de novo metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, addition of an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and prostate radiotherapy to the standard (SOC) improves survival in comparison to the next most effective strategy (SOC + ARPI). For the subgroup with prior definitive treatment of the primary tumor, long-term outcomes and genomic predictors of response to metastasis-directed therapy suggest that this might be a reasonable option in selected patients.
39459070	Prostate cancer is a disease in which cells in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system below the bladder, grow out of control and, among men, it is the second-most frequently diagnosed cancer (other than skin cancer). In recent years, prostate cancer death rate has stabilized and, currently, it is the second-most frequent cause of cancer death in men (after lung cancer). Most deaths occur due to metastasis, as cancer cells from the original tumor establish secondary tumors in distant organs. For a long time, classical cell cultures and animal models have been utilized in basic and applied scientific research, including clinical applications for many diseases, such as prostate cancer, since no better alternatives were available. Although helpful in dissecting cellular mechanisms, these models are poor predictors of physiological behavior mainly because of the lack of appropriate microenvironments. Microfluidics has emerged in the last two decades as a technology that could lead to a paradigm shift in life sciences and, in particular, controlling cancer. Microfluidic systems, such as organ-on-chips, have been assembled to mimic the critical functions of human organs. These microphysiological systems enable the long-term maintenance of cellular co-cultures in vitro to reconstitute in vivo tissue-level microenvironments, bridging the gap between traditional cell cultures and animal models. Several reviews on microfluidics for prostate cancer studies have been published focusing on technology advancement and disease progression. As metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer remains a clinically challenging late-stage cancer, with no curative treatments, we expanded this review to cover recent microfluidic applications related to prostate cancer research. The review includes discussions of the roles of microfluidics in modeling the human prostate, prostate cancer initiation and development, as well as prostate cancer detection and therapy, highlighting potentially major contributions of microfluidics in the continuous march toward eradicating prostate cancer.

39457633	"Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) presents a significant challenge in oncology due to its high mortality rate and the absence of effective biomarkers for predicting patient outcomes. Building on previous research that highlighted the critical role of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 and cell adhesion molecules in promoting tumor progression under hypoxia and estrogen stimulation, this study aimed to assess the potential of these components as prognostic biomarkers for PCa at the biopsy stage.This research utilized immunohistochemistry and droplet digital PCR to analyze formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies, focusing on specific markers within the H19/cell adhesion molecules pathway.A novel multivariate analysis led to a ""BioScore"", a composite biomarker score to predict disease progression. This score is based on evaluating five key markers: the expression levels of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 2 Alpha (HIF-2α), endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS), β4 integrin, E-cadherin transcript (CDH1), and lncRNA H19. The criteria for the ""BioScore"" involve identifying three out of these five markers, combining elevated levels of HIF-2α, eNOS, β4 integrin, and CDH1 with reduced H19 expression.This finding suggests the possibility of identifying, at the time of biopsy, PCa patients at higher risk of metastasis based on dysregulation in the H19/cell adhesion molecules circuitry. This study provides a valuable opportunity for early intervention in managing PCa, potentially contributing to personalized treatment strategies."
39457506	Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men worldwide, with metastasis, particularly to bone, being the primary cause of mortality. Currently, prognostic markers like PSA levels and Gleason classification are limited in predicting metastasis, emphasizing the need for novel clinical biomarkers. New molecules predicting tumor progression have been identified over time. Some, such as the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) PD-1/PD-L1, have become valid markers as theranostic tools essential for prognosis and drug target therapy. However, despite the success of ICIs as an anti-cancer therapy for solid tumors, their efficacy in treating bone metastases has mainly proven ineffective, suggesting intrinsic resistance to this therapy in the bone microenvironment. This study explores the potential of immunological intratumoral biomarkers, focusing on placental growth factor (PlGF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 1 (VEGFR1), and Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1), in predicting bone metastasis formation.we analyzed PCa samples from patients with and without metastasis by immunohistochemical analysis.Results revealed that PlGF expression is significantly higher in primary tumors of patients that developed metastasis within five years from the histological diagnosis. Additionally, PlGF expression correlates with increased VEGFR1 and PD-1 levels, as well as the presence of intratumoral M2 macrophages.These findings suggest that PlGF contributes to an immunosuppressive environment, thus favoring tumor progression and metastatic process. Results here highlight the potential of integrating these molecular markers with existing prognostic tools to enhance the accuracy of metastasis prediction in PCa. By identifying patients at risk for metastasis, clinicians can tailor treatment strategies more effectively, potentially improving survival outcomes and quality of life. This study underscores the importance of further research into the role of intratumoral biomarkers in PCa management.

39450704	Deleterious germline variants in certain DNA repair genes are risk factors for developing aggressive prostate cancer. The objective was to quantify their prognostic impact after prostate cancer diagnosis.Men with prostate cancer, predominantly of European ancestry, were included from four cohorts with long-term follow-up. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in 26 DNA repair genes were assessed in relation to metastasis-free survival in high-risk, localized prostate cancer and to overall survival in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).Among 3,525 patients initially diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer, 2,594 had high-risk localized prostate cancer, 429 mCSPC, and 502 mCRPC at inclusion. BRCA2 variant carriers did not have worse metastasis-free survival in high-risk localized prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69, 1.46) or overall survival in mCSPC (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.14, 1.45) or mCRPC (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31, 1.17) compared to non-carriers of DNA repair variants. Among 868 additional patients with de novo metastatic (M1) prostate cancer, BRCA2 variant carriers tended to have worse overall survival (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.01, 2.51). BRCA2 prognostic associations were not explained by radiation, PARP inhibitor, or platinum therapy. Results for other genes were limited in precision because variants were less common.Among patients with high-risk or metastatic prostate cancer who were initially diagnosed with and treated for non-metastatic tumors, germline DNA repair variants in BRCA2 do not confer a substantially worse prognosis.
39447880	To assess 5-year oncologic outcomes following primary partial gland cryo-ablation (PPGCA) in intermediate risk prostate cancer.Of 476 men undergoing PPGCA enrolled in our prospective oncologic and functional outcomes study, 313 had MRI concordant intermediate risk prostate cancer with no out-of-field Gleason Grade Group (GGG) ≥2, gross extracapsular extension or extreme apical disease on pre-treatment mpMRI. PSA was monitored every 6 months, and mpMRI at 6-12, 24, 42 and 60 months. Protocol biopsy at 6-12 months and 24 months were discontinued after interim analysis showing low rates of clinically-significant prostate cancer (csPCa) defined as any GGG≥2 disease. Freedom-from-failure (FFF) was defined as no prostate cancer specific mortality, metastatic disease, or whole-gland salvage treatment (WGST) RESULTS: csPCa was detected in 33 (10.5%) subjects. 91 had ≥4.5 years of follow-up data with a mean of 8.9, 3.4, and 2.0 surveillance PSA tests, MRIs, and prostate biopsies; none were lost to follow-up. At 5-years, rates of freedom-from-recurrence of in-field, out-of-field and overall csPCa were 86% (95% CI: 78-96), 85% (95% CI: 63-94), and 70% (95% CI: 57-84). The proportion with freedom-from-failure (FFF) at 5 years was 89% (95% CI: 83-95). None died from prostate cancer, 1 (1%) developed metastasis, 15 (16.5%) underwent WGST, and 15 (16.5%) underwent salvage focal therapy (FT). Only 3 of 91 (3.3%) eligible men were noncompliant with 5-year surveillance protocol.Very encouraging intermediate-term oncological outcomes following PPGCA were observed with very high compliance to a rigorous prospective protocol for identifying recurrent csPCa.
39447623	Liquiritigenin (LQ) is a monomeric compound found in licorice, a leguminous plant, and has been reported to exhibit antitumor effects in various lines of cancer cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which LQ exerts its antitumor effects remain largely unknown. In this study, the effects of LQ on the migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of prostate cancer (PCa) cells were investigated. We found that LQ effectively inhibited the migration and invasion of PCa cells in vitro, and this effect was further confirmed in xenograft lung metastasis models. In addition, LQ was found to activate endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) in PCa cells. Further studies found that LQ upregulated the expression of inositol-requiring enzyme type 1α (IRE1). When IRE1 was knocked down, we observed a weakened inhibitory effect of LQ treatment on the migration and invasion of PCa cells. This observation suggests that LQ may inhibit the migration, invasion and EMT of PCa cells through activating the IRE1 branch of ER stress. In conclusion, our research may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for PCa.
39447096	Current clinical risk stratification methods for localized prostate cancer are suboptimal, leading to over- and undertreatment. Recently, machine learning approaches using digital histopathology have shown superior prognostic ability in phase III trials. This study aims to develop a clinically usable risk grouping system using multimodal artificial intelligence (MMAI) models that outperform current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk groups.The cohort comprised 9,787 patients with localized prostate cancer from eight NRG Oncology randomized phase III trials, treated with radiation therapy, androgen deprivation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. Locked MMAI models, which used digital histopathology images and clinical data, were applied to each patient. Expert consensus on cut points defined low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups on the basis of 10-year distant metastasis rates of 3% and 10%, respectively. The MMAI's reclassification and prognostic performance were compared with the three-tier NCCN risk groups.The median follow-up for censored patients was 7.9 years. According to NCCN risk categories, 30.4% of patients were low-risk, 25.5% intermediate-risk, and 44.1% high-risk. The MMAI risk classification identified 43.5% of patients as low-risk, 34.6% as intermediate-risk, and 21.8% as high-risk. MMAI reclassified 1,039 (42.0%) patients initially categorized by NCCN. Despite the MMAI low-risk group being larger than the NCCN low-risk group, the 10-year metastasis risks were comparable: 1.7% (95% CI, 0.2 to 3.2) for NCCN and 3.2% (95% CI, 1.7 to 4.7) for MMAI. The overall 10-year metastasis risk for NCCN high-risk patients was 16.6%, with MMAI further stratifying this group into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk, showing metastasis rates of 3.4%, 8.2%, and 26.3%, respectively.The MMAI risk grouping system expands the population of men identified as having low metastatic risk and accurately pinpoints a high-risk subset with elevated metastasis rates. This approach aims to prevent both overtreatment and undertreatment in localized prostate cancer, facilitating shared decision making.
39445641	Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies in men. The tumour microenvironment (TME) has a critical role in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of prostate cancer. TME contains various cell types, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, immune cells such as macrophages, lymphocytes B and T, natural killer (NK) cells, and other proteins such as extracellular matrix (ECM) components. The interactions and communications between these cells within the TME are crucial for the growth and response of various solid tumours, such as prostate cancer to different anticancer modalities. In this review article, we exemplify the various mechanisms by which the TME influences prostate cancer progression. The roles of different cells, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in modulating the immune response and prostate tumour growth will be discussed. The impact of these cells and factors and other ECM components on tumour cell invasion and metastasis will also be discussed. We explain how these interactions in TME can affect the response of prostate cancer to therapy. We also highlight the importance of understanding these interactions to develop novel therapeutic approaches for prostate cancer.
39442954	SWI/SNF complexes represent a family of multi-subunit chromatin remodelers that are affected by alterations in >20% of human tumors. While mutations of SWI/SNF genes are relatively uncommon in prostate cancer (PCa), the literature suggests that deregulation of various subunits plays a role in prostate tumorigenesis. To assess SWI/SNF functions in a clinical context, we studied the mutually exclusive, paralogue accessory subunits SMARCD1, SMARCD2, and SMARCD3 that are included in every known complex and are sought to confer specificity.Performing immunohistochemistry (IHC), the protein levels of the SMARCD family members were measured using a tissue microarray (TMA) comprising malignant samples and matching healthy tissue of non-metastatic PCa patients (n = 168). Moreover, IHC was performed in castration-resistant tumors (n = 9) and lymph node metastases (n = 22). To assess their potential role as molecular biomarkers, SMARCD1 and SMARCD3 protein levels were correlated with clinical parameters such as T stage, Gleason score, biochemical recurrence, and progression-free survival.SMARCD1 protein levels in non-metastatic primary tumors, lymph node metastases, and castration-resistant samples were significantly higher than in benign tissues. Likewise, SMARCD3 protein expression was elevated in tumor tissue and especially lymph node metastases compared to benign samples. While SMARCD1 levels in primary tumors did not exhibit significant associations with any of the tested clinical parameters, SMARCD3 exhibited an inverse correlation with pre-operative PSA levels. Moreover, low SMARCD3 expression was associated with progression to metastasis.In congruence with previous literature, our results implicate that both SMARCD1 and SMARCD3 may exhibit relevant functions in the context of prostate tumorigenesis. Moreover, our approach suggests a potential role of SMARCD3 as a novel prognostic marker in clinically non-metastatic PCa.
39441869	Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer among men and the fifth leading cause of cancer death. Circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration and characterisation in PCa has been shown to provide valuable information on prognosis of disease, therapy management and detection of resistance. Here, Cellsway's microfluidic platform for high-throughput enrichment of intact CTC populations was used to isolate CTCs from the blood of 20 localised PCa patients and 10 healthy donor samples to evaluate the clinical performance of the technology. To enumerate and characterise CTCs, a multi-parameter flow cytometry analysis was performed on the enriched CTC suspension using CTC-specific biomarkers. CTCs were detected in 17 of 20 patient samples, which corresponds to 85% CTC positivity. The median CTC count per 7.5 ml blood was 2 (1-9). In 80% of patients (n = 16), the number of CTCs ranged from 1 to 5, and in 5% of patients (n = 1) the number of CTCs was above 5. No CTCs were observed in the blood samples of 10 healthy volunteers, demonstrating the high specificity and low risk of false positives of the technology.
39441595	Although prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) has shown improved sensitivity and specificity compared with conventional imaging for the detection of biochemical recurrent (BCR) prostate cancer, the long-term outcomes of a widespread shift in imaging are unknown.To estimate long-term outcomes of integrating PSMA-PET into the staging pathway for recurrent prostate cancer.This decision analytic modeling study simulated outcomes for patients with BCR following initial definitive local therapy. Inputs used were from the literature and a retrospective cohort study conducted at 2 institutions. The base case analysis assumed modest benefits of earlier detection and treatment, and scenario analyses considered prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at imaging and different outcomes of earlier vs delayed treatment. The analysis was performed between April 1, 2023, and May 1, 2024.(1) Immediate PSMA-PET imaging, (2) conventional imaging (computed tomography and bone scan [CTBS]) followed by PSMA-PET if CTBS findings were negative or equivocal, and (3) CTBS alone.The main outcomes were detection of metastases, deaths from prostate cancer, and life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained.The model estimated that per 1000 simulated patients with BCR (assumed median age, 66 years), PSMA-PET is expected to diagnose 611 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 565-656) patients with metastasis compared with 630 (95% UI, 586-675) patients diagnosed using CTBS followed by PSMA-PET and 297 (95% UI, 202-410) patients diagnosed using CTBS alone. Moreover, the estimated number of prostate cancer deaths was 512 (95% UI, 472-552 deaths) with PSMA-PET, 520 (95% UI, 480-559 deaths) with CTBS followed by PSMA-PET, and 587 (95% UI, 538-632 deaths) with CTBS alone. Imaging with PSMA-PET yielded the highest number of QALYs, which were 824 (95% UI, 698-885) higher than CTBS. These results differed by PSA level at the time of testing, with the highest incremental life-years and QALYs and lowest number of deaths from prostate cancer among patients with PSA levels of at least 5.0 ng/mL. Finally, the estimates were sensitive to the expected benefit of initiating therapy for recurrent prostate cancer earlier in the disease course.The results of this decision-analytic model suggest that upfront PSMA-PET imaging for the evaluation of BCR is expected to be associated with reduced cancer mortality and gains in life-years and QALYs compared with the conventional imaging strategy, assuming modest benefits of earlier detection and treatment.
39439457	The most general cancer in men is prostate cancer (PCa), with its risk increasing due to age and obesity. Visfatin, a member of adipokines, is related to cancer progression and metastasis, but its relationship in PCa remains undetermined. In addition, no knowledge is available regarding relations between 
39435284	Synchronous occurrence of prostate cancer (PCa) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is uncommon. RCC has a higher tendency to metastasize to the adrenal glands, renal hilar, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes compared to PCa. To date, there are no documented cases existing where metastatic tumors in these regions, observed in patients concurrently with PCa and RCC, have originated from the PCa rather than the RCC.In this case report, we described a 67-year-old male presented with dysuria for two months and left lower extremity edema for three days. Percutaneous biopsies revealed synchronous primary RCC and PCa. However, the origin of the metastatic tumors, especially those involving the adrenal glands, renal hilum, and retroperitoneal regions, remained undetermined. Subsequent surgical procedures identified that the metastatic lesions originated from the PCa, while the RCC was localized. Ultimately, the patient with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) received combination therapy with rezvilutamide and goserelin, which resulted in a satisfactory treatment response.In patients with concurrent PCa and RCC, metastatic lesions in the adrenal glands, renal hilar, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes may also originate from the PCa. Accurate identification of the primary tumor and proper staging are critical for the appropriate management of patients with multiple primary malignancies with concurrent metastases.
39434745	Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is regarded as a crucial component of radical prostatectomy (RP); however, it also increases the probability of postoperative complications. This study aimed to investigate the significance of PLND in the treatment of prostate cancer.A total of 1,474 patients with complete clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors of PLND and lymph node metastasis (LNM). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance baseline characteristics between patients in different groups, along with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to explore the impact of PLND on oncological outcomes.Of the 1,474 patients, 956 (64.9%) underwent PLND, and 159 (16.6%) had LNM. The positive rate of lymph nodes in the extended PLND (ePLND) group was higher than that in the obturator resection group (20.58% ePLND is recommended for patients with indications of lymphadenectomy, which can significantly optimize the detection rate of positive lymph nodes and provide guidance for subsequent adjuvant therapy.
39427278	To investigate the prognostic value of baseline health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for patients with intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer (IR-PCa) undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).4780 patients with IR-PCa according to NCCN risk stratification were identified from a prospectively maintained database. All patients were treated with RP and had prospectively assessed baseline HRQOL. Main outcomes were oncologic endpoints metastasis-free survival (MFS); biochemical recurrence free survival (BRFS) and overall survival (OS). Multivariable Cox regression models assessed prognostic significance of baseline global health status (GHS) on survival outcomes. Harrell's discrimination C-index was applied to calculate the predictive accuracy of the model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) tested the clinical net benefit associated with adding the GHS domain to our multivariable model (p < 0.05).Median follow-up was 51 months. Multivariable analysis confirmed baseline GHS as an independent predictor for increased MFS (HR 0.976, 95%CI 0.96-0.99; p < 0.001), increased BRFS (HR 0.993, 95%CI 0.99-1.00; p = 0.027) and increased OS (HR 0.969, 95%CI 0.95-0.99; p = 0.002), indicating a relative risk reduction of 2.4% for MFS, 0.7% for BRFS and 3.1% for OS per 1-point increase of baseline GHS. Baseline HRQOL improved discrimination in predicting MFS, BRFS and OS. DCA revealed a net benefit over all threshold probabilities.We found baseline HRQOL to substantially improve risk stratification for the heterogeneous cohort of IR-PCa. Baseline HRQOL accurately predicts increased MFS, BRFS and OS. Our findings therefore support the role of preoperative HRQOL as an adjunct to established prognosticators for IR-PCa, potentially facilitating guidance of therapy.
39426804	We determined the optimal timing for initiating androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) therapy in patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) and assessed its impact on oncological outcomes.This retrospective study included 145 nmCRPC patients who received enzalutamide, apalutamide or darolutamide at the Jikei University Hospital or its affiliated institutions between May 2014 and November 2022. Patients were stratified based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time (PSADT) at CRPC diagnosis and PSA levels at ARSI initiation. Oncological outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), cancer-specific survival and overall survival, were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis.The median age of the patients was 73 (interquartile range [IQR]: 52-88) years, and the median follow-up duration was 36 (IQR: 2-104) months. The median PSA level at ARSI initiation was 5.4 (IQR: 2.2-48) ng/ml, and 44.8% of patients had a PSADT <3 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that PSADT and PSA levels at ARSI initiation were independent MFS predictors. Patients with a PSADT ≤3 months and a PSA level ≥5.4 ng/ml experienced significantly reduced PFS and MFS. Notably, ARSI initiation at a PSA level ≥5.4 ng/ml was associated with worse outcomes, suggesting the potential benefit of earlier intervention.Patients with rapid PSADT are at increased risk of early disease progression, suggesting that immediate treatment may be warranted. In addition, initiating therapy at a PSA level <5.4 ng/ml may be associated with improved patient outcomes in patients with low PSADT.
39424989	In this investigation, we explored the molecular dynamics guiding the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) influenced by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-mediated M2 polarization of macrophages through the IL-17RA/CTSK/EMT axis. An 830-patient clinical trial categorized subjects into hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) and CRPC groups. H. pylori infection, evaluated by ELISA, exhibited a higher incidence in CRPC patients, impacting overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival. In-depth in vitro and in vivo experiments, including 16S rDNA sequencing, immunohistochemical tests, and transcriptome analysis, unveiled that H. pylori promotes CRPC growth and metastasis by upregulating IL-17RA and CTSK, leading to enhanced EMT. Notably, M2 macrophages emerged as pivotal immune cells influencing CRPC progression. This study uncovers a novel pathway wherein H. pylori enrichment exacerbates CRPC by inducing macrophage M2 polarization, IL-17RA/CTSK expression, and EMT activation, shedding light on a previously unrecognized mechanism contributing to the growth and metastasis of CRPC.
39424079	Men with high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) are treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiotherapy, but the disease reoccurs in 30% of patients. Biochemical recurrence of PCa after treatment is influenced by tumour hypoxia. Tumours with high levels of hypoxia are aggressive, resistant to treatment, and have increased metastatic capacity. Gene expression signatures derived from diagnostic biopsies can predict tumour hypoxia and radiosensitivity, but none are in routine clinical use, due to concerns about the applicability of these biomarkers to new patient cohorts. There has been no or limited testing in cohorts of high-risk PCa.We generated transcriptomic data for cohorts of high-risk PCa patients. Patients were treated with ADT followed by external beam radiotherapy with or without a brachytherapy boost. Biomarkers curated from the literature were calculated from pre-treatment biopsy gene expression data. The primary endpoint for survival analyses was biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS) and the secondary endpoints were distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and overall survival.The performance of the selected biomarkers was poor, with none achieving prognostic significance for bRFS or DMFS in any cohort. The brachytherapy boost cohort received shorter durations of ADT than the conventionally fractionated or hypofractionated cohorts (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p=2.1 × 10Hypoxia and radiosensitivity biomarkers were not prognostic in high-risk PCa patients treated with ADT plus radiotherapy. We speculate that the lack of prognostic capability could be caused by the variable hypoxia-modifying effects of the ADT that these high-risk patients received before and during definitive treatment with radiotherapy. A deeper understanding of biomarker construction, performance and inter-cohort transferability in relation to patient characteristics, sample handling and treatment modalities is required before hypoxia biomarkers can be recommended for routine clinical use in the pre-treatment setting.
39423052	There is limited data on PSMA PET/CT for work-up of recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) at low PSA values. We evaluated a PSMA PET/CT cohort of post-RP patients, focusing on patients with PSA <0.5 ng/mL.We identified a retrospective cohort who underwent piflufolastat F-18 PSMA PET/CT across an eleven-hospital system from 7/2021-2/2023. PSMA positivity was determined by radiology reports. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with suspicious PSMA activity.Median PSA was 0.37 ng/mL (IQR 0.15, 1.29 ng/mL), with 49% of patients overall having at least one suspicious PSMA-avid lesion. Rates of scan positivity among patients with PSA <0.2 and 0.2-0.5 ng/mL were 34% and 38%, respectively. Among all patients, 25% (104/415) had pelvic disease (prostate bed or N1), and 24% (100/415) had M1 disease. Among patients with PSA <0.5 ng/mL, prior post-operative radiation was associated with suspicious PSMA activity. In the overall cohort, age, PSA at PSMA PET/CT, and RP Gleason Grade (GG) were associated with PSMA positivity. PSADT, EAU risk, and CAPRA-S were all associated with suspicious PSMA activity.Over one-third of patients with PSAs <0.2 ng/mL had imaging findings concerning for recurrence. Prior post-operative radiation was associated with higher rates of PSMA positivity among patients with PSA <0.5 ng/mL, and half of patients with evidence of PSMA avid distant metastatic disease underwent metastasis directed therapy. PET-PSMA imaging at low PSAs can be considered to inform salvage therapies.
39422767	To determine new-onset or worsening T2DM risk in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) receiving abiraterone acetate (AA) vs. enzalutamide (ENZA) in England.Records of patients on AA and/or ENZA (2015-2021) were analysed retrospectively from UK- or England-wide databases and data sets. The primary endpoint was new-onset or worsening T2DM, analysed using a Cox model.Of 1382 patients, 84 (6.1%) met the primary endpoint; 42 of 826 patients (5.1%) received ENZA and 42 of 556 patients (7.6%) received AA. Among patients without baseline T2DM (n = 1049), 50 developed new-onset T2DM: 24 (3.9%) on ENZA and 26 (5.9%) on AA. Among patients with baseline T2DM (n = 333), 34 (10.2%) had worsening T2DM: 18 (8.3%) on ENZA and 16 (13.8%) on AA. Patients on ENZA had longer median follow-up (445 vs. 408 days) and treatment duration (164 vs. 139 days) than those on AA, who were also more likely to have new-onset or worsening T2DM than those on ENZA (HR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.4-2.7; P = 0.0101). The number needed to harm for an additional patient to experience new-onset or worsening T2DM when receiving AA instead of ENZA was 40 overall, 50 in patients without baseline T2DM, and 18 in patients with baseline T2DM.Patients with mCRPC receiving AA were more likely to experience new-onset or worsening T2DM than those on ENZA, despite having a shorter treatment duration. Further research is required to substantiate these findings in earlier disease settings with longer treatment duration.
39420060	For prostate cancer patients who experience biochemical progression during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA PET/CT) has not been prospectively compared to planar bone scan plus CT. This was a single-arm, head-to-head, prospective phase II trial (NCT04928820) designed to enroll 102 men with prostate cancer who experienced biochemical progression (rising prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ≥ 1 ng/mL) during ADT. All patients received 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP planar bone scans. Each scan was interpreted by three central independent readers. The primary endpoint was the per-patient bone metastasis detection rate of PSMA PET/CT versus planar bone scan and CT. Secondary endpoints compared the number of bone metastases detected per patient and the inter-reader agreement of each imaging modality. Twenty-two men were enrolled between July 2021 and June 2022. Due to slow accrual following approval of PSMA PET radiotracers in the U.S. and a lack of a statistical signal between the two imaging modalities on interim analysis, this trial was closed early on October 2022. Median PSA was 8.5 ng/mL (interquartile range: 1.6-77.6). There was 100% agreement between the two scans. Six patients (27%) had negative findings and 16 patients (73%) had positive findings on both scans. PSMA PET/CT and bone scan plus CT detected an equal number of bone lesions for 14 patients (64%), PSMA PET/CT detected more bone lesions for six patients (27%), and bone scan plus CT detected more bone lesions for two patients (9.1%) (p = 0.092). The inter-reader agreement rates of PSMA PET/CT and bone scan plus CT were 96% and 82%, respectively (p = 0.25). In men with biochemical progression during ADT, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP planar bone scan plus CT had identical bone metastasis detection rates. Bone scan plus CT can continue to serve as a cost-effective and readily accessible restaging modality in patients with biochemical progression. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04928820. Registered 16/06/2021.
39419868	Determining the potential benefit of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and adjuvant ADT in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC) undergoing complete resection.139 patients diagnosed with cT3-4, or cN+ LAPC in Xiangya Hospital and The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China from 2010 to 2021 were collected. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) of patients were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional risk analysis. We also analyzed the functional outcomes of two subgroups of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP).Of the 182 patients with cT3-4, or cN+ LAPC, 139 patients (76.4%) were enrolled in the study with a 5-year survival rate of 82.3%. 45 patients (32.4%) received ADT alone, 46 patients (33.1%) received neoadjuvant ADT before surgery, and the remaining 48 patients (34.5%) received surgery with adjuvant ADT. Neoadjuvant ADT before surgery and surgery with adjuvant ADT were associated with significantly improved survival compared with ADT alone. Multivariate Cox models showed that neoadjuvant ADT before surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 0.29; 95% CI 0.13-0.92) or surgery with adjuvant ADT (HR, 0.26; 95% CI 0.16-0.78) was associated with improved CSS compared with ADT alone. Regional lymph node metastasis, positive lymphovascular invasion, and Gleason score 9 + were independent predictors of LAPC CSS and OS. More patients in the neoadjuvant ADT before surgery group achieved final continence status within 12 months after surgery (93.48% v 77.08%).CSS and OS were significantly prolonged in cT3-4, or cN+ LAPC patients who received neoadjuvant ADT before surgery and surgery with adjuvant ADT compared to ADT alone.
39415352	Although RANK-LRANK interaction is essential for osteoclastogenesis, the mechanisms by which cancer cells invade bone tissues and initiate osteolytic metastasis remain unclear. Here, we show that the hyperactivation of RelB fosters prostate cancer (PCa) osteolytic metastasis by coordinating interleukin-8 (IL-8) and calcium-binging protein A4 (S100A4).The factors promoting PCa bone metastasis were investigated in sera from PCa patients and tumour tissues derived from nude mice using immunohistochemical analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Cell mobility and mineralization were quantified using BioStation CT and Osteolmage assay. The relative cistrome was investigated in advanced PCa cells by standard transcriptional analyses, including the luciferase reporter response, site-directed mutagenesis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. PCa cell-initiated tumour formation, expansion, and bone metastasis were validated in mice using multiple approaches, including orthotopic, intraskeletal, and caudal arterial implantation models.IL-8 and S100A4 correlated with patient Gleason scores and bone metastasis. RelB upregulated IL-8, facilitating androgen receptor (AR)-independent growth. RelB-Sp1 interaction enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by activating Snail and Twist. RelB-NFAT1c super-enhancer upregulated S100A4 in the organization of the cytoskeleton and bone metastasis. The RelB-IL-8-S100A4 signalling axis was confirmed to promote osteolytic metastasis in nude mice.RelB-IL-8 reciprocally promoted EMT by activating inflammatory signalling and inactivating AR signalling. IL-8 is essential for provoking PCa metastasis but insufficient to drive bone metastasis. IL-8-S100A4 cooperation was necessary for metastatic cells to target the bone.RelB activates inflammatory signalling by upregulating IL-8 and suppressing AR. RelB upregulates S100A4 by cooperating with NFATC1. IL-8 boosts EMT by activating Snail 1 and Twist 1, and S100A4 exacerbates osteolytic metastasis via calcium consumption. RelB harnesses IL-8 and S100A4 to drive PCa osteolytic metastasis.
39415320	Bone metastasis is the primary cause of death among patients with advanced prostate cancer (PCa). PCa tends to spread to bones and acquire the bone-like phenotype, causing osteoblastic bone metastasis. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for this condition. However, melatonin, which regulates our circadian rhythm, has been found to have anti-tumor properties. It has yet to be established whether it is effective in treating osteoblastic PCa metastasis. Our findings show that melatonin inhibits the production of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in osteoblastic PCa cells, suppressing osteoblast differentiation. Clinical results indicate that bone metastatic PCa patients have higher levels of ET-1 compared to nonmetastatic PCa patients. Furthermore, melatonin-induced miR-let-7f-5p inhibits ET-1-promoted osteoblast differentiation in osteoblastic PCa. Melatonin also suppresses the property of osteomimicry in osteoblastic PCa cells. Importantly, in the intratibia injection PCa metastasis model, melatonin decreased osteoblastic PCa tumor growth, inhibiting ET-1 production and osteoblast differentiation in vivo. Taken together, melatonin inhibits osteoblastic PCa-regulated osteoblastogenesis by reducing ET-1 production through upregulation of miR-let-7f-5p, while suppressing the property of osteomimicry in osteoblastic PCa. Melatonin therapy could be a promising approach to treating bone metastasis in osteoblastic PCa.
39405060	Preclinical studies suggest that exposure to prostate-directed local therapy (LT) may influence the efficacy of subsequent systemic therapy including androgen receptor pathway inhibitors. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to support this premise in patients with nonmetastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC).To determine whether exposure to prior prostate-directed LT (radical prostatectomy [RP], radiation therapy [RT], or both) played any effect-modifying role in the treatment effect of apalutamide on metastasis-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with nmCRPC.This post hoc secondary analysis used individual patient data from SPARTAN (Study of Apalutamide [ARN-509] in Men With Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer), a phase 3, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted at 332 sites in 26 countries. Between October 14, 2013, and December 15, 2016, patients with nmCRPC and a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of 10 months or less were randomly assigned to apalutamide vs placebo; all patients received androgen deprivation therapy. The final data analysis was performed on December 31, 2023.Prior prostate-directed LT.Separate Cox proportional hazards regression models were constructed for OS and MFS, which included prior LT, treatment group, and an interaction term, in addition to a minimally sufficient set of confounders. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for MFS and OS were determined for the apalutamide groups with or without prior LT.Among the 1179 evaluable patients included in this analysis, 795 received prior LT and 384 did not. The median age of patients with and without prior LT was 70 (IQR, 45-90) years and 75 (IQR, 50-95) years, respectively. The median follow-up was 52.0 (IQR, 51.5-52.8) months. A differential treatment effect of apalutamide on MFS was observed between patients with and without prior LT (P for interaction = .009), with greater benefits for those with prior LT (adjusted HR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.17-0.27]) compared with those without prior LT (adjusted HR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.25-0.51]). However, there was insufficient evidence of a differential treatment effect on OS among subgroups stratified by exposure to prior LT (P for interaction = .23), with improved OS in the subgroup with prior LT (adjusted HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.57-0.92]) but no significant difference in OS in the subgroup without prior LT (adjusted HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.64-1.31]).This post hoc analysis of the SPARTAN trial provides evidence of an interaction between prior LT and apalutamide in patients with nmCRPC, with a clinically significant and more favorable treatment effect from apalutamide on MFS among patients with prior LT. Further studies are needed to validate these findings.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01946204.
39404386	Most patients with metastatic prostate cancer eventually develop resistance to primary androgen deprivation therapy. To identify predictive biomarker for Abiraterone acetate/prednisone resistance, we screened alternative splice variants between responders and non-responders from the PROMOTE clinical study and pinned down the most significant variant, CENPK-delta8. Through preclinical patient-derived mouse xenograft (PDX) and 3D organoids obtained from responders and non-responders, as well as in vitro models, aberrant CENPK-delta8 expression was determined to link to drug resistance via enhanced migration and proliferation. The FLNA and FLOT1 were observed to specifically bind to CENK-delta8 rather than wild-type CENPK, underscoring the role of CENPK-delta8 in cytoskeleton organization and cell migration. Our study, leveraging data from the PROMOTE study, TCGA, and TCGA SpliceReq databases, highlights the important function of alternative splice variants in drug response and their potential to be prognostic biomarkers for improving individual therapeutic outcomes in precision medicine.
39403999	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), nano-sized particles secreted by cells, are increasingly recognized as promising biomarkers. However, the isolation and purification of EVs need improvement, impeding their practical application. Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) offer a method to separate EVs with high purity and yield compared to other techniques, yet the unclear isolation mechanism limits efficiency. To elucidate the separation process and enhance ATPS-based EV isolation, Kramers' theory and Fick's law are employed. The simulations and experiments reveal that the liquid-liquid interface in ATPS acts as a size cut-off filter for EVs, functioning without a membrane. It is discovered that rapid transport of particles to the interface is crucial for fast isolation, but this transport in separated phases relies solely on diffusion, which slows the process. To address this, a vortex is introduced to enhance particle movement through convection, significantly improving efficiency. This method achieves over 80% recovery of EVs from blood plasma and removes more than 90% of low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and albumin within an hour. Applying this ATPS-based membrane-less filter to plasma from prostate cancer patients, concentrations of markers on EVs are quantified. Using machine learning, metastatic and non-metastatic prostate cancer are distinguished with greater accuracy than the traditional PSA-based method.
39399223	Cancer pain is a growing problem, especially with the substantial increase in cancer survival. Reports indicate that bone metastasis, whose primary symptom is bone pain, occurs in 65-75% of patients with advanced breast or prostate cancer. We optimized a preclinical 
39398910	We report the case of a 65 year-old male with prostate cancer previously treated with external beam radiotherapy and 2 years of androgen deprivation therapy. His nadir PSA reached undetectable level but gradually increased to 0.89 ng/dL.

39395905	Prostate cancer (PCa) is a serious malignancy. The main causes of PCa aggravation and death are unexplained resistance to chemotherapy and bone metastases.This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with the dynamic processes of progression, bone metastasis, and chemoresistance in PCa.Through comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) tumor progression and metastasis-related genes were identified. These genes were subjected to lasso regression modeling using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were used to evaluate osteoclast differentiation. CellMiner was used to confirm the effect of LDHA on chemoresistance. Finally, the relationship between LDHA and chemoresistance was verified using doxorubicin-resistant PCa cell lines.7928 genes were identified as genes related to tumor progression and metastasis. Of these, 7 genes were found to be associated with PCa prognosis. The scRNA-seq and TCGA data showed that the expression of LDHA was higher in tumors and associated with poor prognosis of PCa. In addition, upregulation of LDHA in PCa cells induces osteoclast differentiation. Additionally, high LDHA expression was associated with resistance to Epirubicin, Elliptinium acetate, and doxorubicin. Cellular experiments demonstrated that LDHA knockdown inhibited doxorubicin resistance in PCa cells.LDHA may play a potential contributory role in PCa initiation and development, bone metastasis, and chemoresistance. LDHA is a key target for the treatment of PCa.
39387315	In Latin America, prostate cancer is the third most common cancer overall and the most common in men, with the highest mortality rate of all cancers. In 2022, there were approximately 22,985 new prostate cancer cases and 61,056 deaths from prostate cancer in the region. Patients with metastatic disease that is resistant to cure by castration now have multiple therapeutic options, including poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors. These treatment advances present new challenges, such as developing monitoring protocols for early detection of disease progression to castration resistance. The Americas Health Foundation organized a 3-day meeting with 8 regional oncologists and pathologists to create a paper on metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer diagnosis and therapy, including the new poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors. The panel examined metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in Latin America and recommended ways to improve patient care using published literature and their expertise. Gene mutations play an important role in prostate cancer development. Precision medicine innovations highlight the importance of genotyping DNA variants and tumor biomarkers for targeted treatment. Access to appropriate genetic testing is difficult, medications are available but expensive, and there is a lack of infrastructure and regulatory frameworks that prevent patients from benefiting from innovative therapies. The panel recommends developing a population database and biobank and creating tumor tissue collection, processing, and storage facilities. Multi-stakeholder collaboration is needed to integrate the information gathered, train staff, select target populations, improve patient accessibility, and reduce the cost burden of drugs, genetic counselors, and cancer geneticists in Latin America. Collaboration is essential among healthcare professionals, policymakers, patient advocacy groups, pharmaceutical companies, and international organizations to address these challenges and needs in Latin America.
39391236	Bone metastasis from prostate cancer severely impacts patient outcomes and quality of life. Anoikis, a form of programmed cell death triggered by the loss of cell-matrix interactions, plays a critical role in cancer progression. However, its precise relationship with prostate cancer-induced bone metastasis remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate this relationship, focusing on anoikis-related gene signatures, molecular pathways, and therapeutic implications.We used the TCGA-PRAD dataset for training, with MSKCC and GSE70769 as validation cohorts. To evaluate immunotherapy efficacy, we examined IMvigor 210 and GSE91016 datasets, and GSE137829 provided single-cell insights into prostate cancer. Specific anoikis-related genes (ARGs) were identified, and Random Survival Forest analysis and multivariate Cox regression were employed to develop anoikis-linked features. The 'clustanoikisProfilanoikis' and 'GSEA' packages were used to explore potential ARG-related pathways.Analyzing 553 samples from TCGA, 231 from MSKCC, 94 from GSE70769, and single-cell data from 6 prostate cancer patients (GSE137829), we constructed a prognostic model based on 9 ARGs. GSVA revealed upregulation of carcinogenic pathways, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, E2F targets, and angiogenesis, with downregulation of metabolic pathways. Significant differences in somatic mutations were observed between cohorts, with a positive correlation between anoikis scores and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Immune landscape analysis suggested high-risk patients might benefit more from chemotherapy than immunotherapy based on their risk score. Single-cell analysis indicated overactivation of carcinogenic pathways in the high anoikis score group.This study elucidates the complex interplay between anoikis and bone metastasis in prostate cancer. Our findings highlight the critical role of anoikis in metastatic progression, enhancing the understanding of key biomarkers and molecular dynamics. The identified anoikis-related gene signatures and disrupted pathways offer promising avenues for predictive and therapeutic strategies in prostate cancer management.
39379238	Decipher is a tissue-based genomic classifier (GC) developed and validated in the post-radical prostatectomy (RP) setting as a predictor of metastasis. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled cluster-crossover trial assessing the use of Decipher to determine its impact on adjuvant treatment after RP.Eligible patients had undergone RP within 9 mo of enrollment, had pT3-4 disease and/or positive surgical margins, and prostate-specific antigen <0.1 ng/ml. Centers were randomized to a sequence of 3-mo periods of either GC-informed care or usual care (UC). Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical (CAPRA-S) recurrence risk scores were provided to treating physicians and patients in all periods.Impact of GC test results on adjuvant treatment were compared with UC alone. Longitudinal patient-reported urinary and sexual function was assessed. A total of 175 patients were enrolled in 27 periods with GC and 163 in 28 periods with UC. At 18 mo after RP, an average patient in the GC arm received adjuvant treatment 9.7% of the time compared with 8.7% for an average individual in the UC arm (0.99% mean difference, 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.6%, 9.6%, p = 0.8). While controlling for CAPRA-S score, higher GC scores tended to result in an increased likelihood of adjuvant treatment that was not statistically significant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.35 per 0.1 increase in GC score, 95% CI 0.98-1.85, p = 0.066). Using the GC risk groups, reflecting clinical use, a high GC risk was associated with significantly higher odds of receiving adjuvant treatment (OR = 6.9, 95% CI 1.8, 26, p = 0.005) compared with a low GC score, adjusted for CAPRA-S score. There were no differences in patient-reported urinary and sexual function between the study arms. As oncologic outcomes are immature, the present data cannot address whether GC testing provides any cancer control benefit.GC testing impacts adjuvant therapy administration when viewed through the risk categories presented in the patient report; however, these data do not provide specific support for GC testing in the adjuvant treatment setting.
