"ORPHA:145 	 Hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer syndrome"	33463063	As one of the most abundant immune cell populations in the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play important roles in multiple solid malignancies, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer. TAMs could contribute to carcinogenesis, neoangiogenesis, immune-suppressive TME remodeling, cancer chemoresistance, recurrence, and metastasis. Therefore, reprogramming of the immune-suppressive TAMs by pharmacological approaches has attracted considerable research attention in recent years. In this review, the promising pharmaceutical targets, as well as the existing modulatory strategies of TAMs were summarized. The chemokine-chemokine receptor signaling, tyrosine kinase receptor signaling, metabolic signaling, and exosomal signaling have been highlighted in determining the biological functions of TAMs. Besides, both preclinical research and clinical trials have suggested the chemokine-chemokine receptor blockers, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, bisphosphonates, as well as the exosomal or nanoparticle-based targeting delivery systems as the promising pharmacological approaches for TAMs deletion or reprogramming. Lastly, the combined therapies of TAMs-targeting strategies with traditional treatments or immunotherapies as well as the exosome-like nanovesicles for cancer therapy are prospected.

"ORPHA:145 	 Hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer syndrome"	21192841	Hedgehog was first described in Drosophila melanogaster by the Nobel laureates Eric Wieschaus and Christiane NÃ¼sslein-Volhard. The hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a major regulator of cell differentiation, proliferation, tissue polarity, stem cell maintenance, and carcinogenesis. The first link of Hh signaling to cancer was established through studies of a rare familial disease, Gorlin syndrome, in 1996. Follow-up studies revealed activation of this pathway in basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma and, leukemia as well as in gastrointestinal, lung, ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer. Targeted inhibition of Hh signaling is now believed to be effective in the treatment and prevention of human cancer. The discovery and synthesis of specific inhibitors for this pathway are even more exciting. In this review, we summarize major advances in the understanding of Hh signaling pathway activation in human cancer, mouse models for studying Hh-mediated carcinogenesis, the roles of Hh signaling in tumor development and metastasis, antagonists for Hh signaling and their clinical implications.
"ORPHA:145 	 Hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer syndrome"	20718644	Strong opioids such as morphine are rarely accessible in low- and middle-income countries, even for patients with the most severe pain. The three cases reported here from three diverse countries provide examples of the terrible and unnecessary suffering that occurs everyday when this essential, inexpensive, and safe medication is not adequately accessible by patients in pain. The reasons for this lack of accessibility are explored, and ways to resolve the problem are proposed.
"ORPHA:145 	 Hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer syndrome"	8053645	Cancer of unknown primary is a clinical challenge that occurs in about 10% of the cancer patients. The major goal is to identify curable patients, while unnecessary efforts and discomfort should be avoided in intreatable patients. Extensive radiological examinations and serum tumour markers have turned out to be unsatisfactory means to establish the origin of the metastasis in patients with cancer of unknown origin. The crucial step for precise diagnosis is histopathological examination of the malignant tissue. Transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry and genetic analysis are being increasingly used in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with cancer of unknown primary. Once a diagnosis is strongly suggested, specific treatment can be administered according to treatment in advanced known cancer. While regional disease is amenable to surgery and/or radiation therapy, multimodality treatment should be considered in treatable disseminated disease. Subsets of patients with a favourable prognosis include non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma, germ cell tumours and thyroid cancer. A fair response to combination therapy can be expected in breast, ovarian and prostate cancer, while metastatic gastrointestinal or urogenital tumours remain difficult to treat. If it is not possible to identify the primary, empiric chemotherapy may provide a chance for cure in about 5% of the cases. The most common regimen employs 5-fluorouracil, adriblastin and mitomycin C. All in all, the prognosis of patients with the CUP-syndrome remains poor--the median survival in somewhat less than six months.
