39474560	This report presents a case of an exceptionally delayed distant recurrence of a choroidal melanoma, occurring 4 decades after the enucleation of the affected eye.In 1977, a 29-year-old man underwent enucleation for a choroidal melanoma. At the age of 68 years, he was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. Although the metastatic prostate cancer responded to treatment, a persistent lung lesion warranted further examination. A lung biopsy, somewhat surprisingly, confirmed the presence of melanoma metastasis, 4 decades after the enucleation. The cells were positive for Melan-A, while no The recurrence of a choroidal melanoma is substantiated by the histopathological and molecular analyses, including the finding of a 
39473410	Chromosomal rearrangements and recurrent gene fusions were previously presumed to be the primary oncogenic mechanisms of hematological malignancies. However, the discovery of gene fusions in different cancers has opened new horizons to comprehensively investigate how cell type-specific fusion oncoproteins modulate signaling cascades. Prostate cancer (PCa) is a multifaceted and therapeutically challenging disease, and functional genomics have helped us develop a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying prostate carcinogenesis, castration-resistant PCa, and metastasis. Keeping in mind the fact that gene fusions have also been discovered in PCa, there has been rapid expansion in the field of molecular oncology and researchers are uncovering new facets regarding the mechanistic regulation of signaling pathways by fusion oncoproteins.
39473059	Approximately 15% of patients with localized prostate cancer are at high risk for disease recurrence. Many clinical trials have evaluated the impact of neoadjuvant therapy before radical prostatectomy with mixed results (NCT00321698).This phase I/II clinical trial evaluated the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of neoadjuvant radiation therapy and docetaxel before prostatectomy in 25 men with high-risk prostate cancer. The treatment regimen included 45 Gy radiotherapy in 25 fractions to the prostate and seminal vesicles over 5 weeks, along with weekly dose-escalated docetaxel up to 30 mg/m², followed by prostatectomy and bilateral lymph node dissection. The primary endpoint was the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR). Secondary endpoints included adverse events, symptom and quality of life measures, and prostate-specific antigen metrics.All 25 patients completed the planned treatment. The primary endpoint of pCR was not achieved. Lymphopenia was the most common grade 3 or higher toxicity, with no grade 3 or higher genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicities observed. With a median follow-up of 11.6 years, the 10-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was 60%, and distant metastasis-free survival was 80%. Prostate cancer-specific survival and overall survival at 10 years were 84% and 60%, respectively.Although pCR was not met, the treatment demonstrated a modest toxicity profile and reasonable long-term outcomes, suggesting feasibility and safety. Further studies are needed to optimize endpoints and assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatments compared with standard approaches in high-risk prostate cancer patients.
39472200	Lymph node dissection (LND) has been standard in cancer surgery for more than a century, yet evidence from randomized trials showing a benefit is scarce. We conducted a clinically integrated randomized trial comparing limited versus extended pelvic LND (PLND) during radical prostatectomy and previously reported comparable biochemical recurrence (BCR) rates. We report updated BCR rates and compare rates of metastasis between the study arms.Between October 2011 and March 2017, 1432 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were enrolled at a single center. Surgeons were cluster randomized to perform limited (external iliac nodes) or extended PLND (external iliac, obturator, and hypogastric nodes) with crossover for 3-mo periods. Cox proportional-hazards regression with robust standard errors clustered by surgeon was used to assess whether the PLND template affected BCR or distant or locoregional metastasis.There were 452 BCR events at median follow-up of 4.2 yr for participants who did not develop BCR. The results confirm our previous finding of comparable BCR rates between the arms (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-1.13; p = 0.3). However, with 123 metastasis events and median follow-up of 5.4 yr for patients without metastasis, we found a clinically and statistically significant protective effect of extended PLND against metastasis (any metastasis: HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.93; p = 0.003; distant metastasis: HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64-0.88; p < 0.001).Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy should receive extended PLND that includes the external iliac, obturator, and hypogastric nodes. Further research should examine biological mechanisms regarding the anatomic location of affected nodes. Trials of LND for other cancers are warranted and should consider our clinically integrated design. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01407263.
39470422	Background An artificial intelligence (AI)-based method for measuring intraprostatic tumor volume based on data from MRI may provide prognostic information. Purpose To evaluate whether the total volume of intraprostatic tumor from AI-generated segmentations (V
39468217	Focal Therapy (FT) is a treatment option for the treatment of limited volume clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). We aim to systematically review outcomes of established FT modalities to assess the contemporary baseline and identify gaps in evidence that will aid in further trial and study design.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all primary studies reporting outcomes of FT using cryotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), and irreversible electroporation (IRE). We described patient inclusion criteria, selection tools, treatment parameters, and surveillance protocols, and pooled overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), biochemical progression (BP), biopsy, secondary treatment, sexual, and urinary function outcomes. Composite failure was defined as salvage whole gland ablation, radical treatment, hormonal therapy or transition to watchful waiting.We identified 49 unique cohorts of men undergoing FT between 2008 and 2024 (21 cryotherapy, 20 HIFU, and 8 IRE). Median follow-up ranged from 6 to 63 months. Pooled OS was 98.0%, CSS 99.3%, and MFS 98.5%. Pooled BP was 9.4%/year. Biopsy was mandated post-FT within 24 months in 36/49 (73.5%) cohorts, with pooled csPCa (GG ≥ 2) rates of 22.2% overall, 8.9% infield, and 12.3% outfield. The pooled rate of secondary FT was 5.0%, radical treatment 10.5%, and composite failure 14.1%. Of 35 studies reporting sexual function, 45.7% reported a low, 48.6% moderate, and 5.7% severe impact. For 34 cohorts reporting urinary function, 97.1% reported a low impact. No differences were noted between cryotherapy, HIFU, or IRE in any of the outcomes.FT with cryotherapy, HIFU, and IRE is associated with good short-intermediate term oncological and functional outcomes. However, outcome reporting is heterogeneous and often incomplete. Long-term follow-up and standardized reporting are required to better define and report FT outcomes.
39467994	Androgen-receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) become the new standard of care for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). It is unknown whether time to castration resistance (TTCR), when using the first-line ARSIs, offers predictive value in mHSPC. We sought to assess the clinical outcomes for mHSPC patients treated with first-line ARSIs focusing on the TTCR.Data from the ULTRA-Japan study cohort from five academic institutes (496 mHSPC patients) were retrospectively analyzed.The median overall survival (OS) in the total cohort was 80 months with a median follow-up of 18 months. Of 496 patients, 332 (67%), 82 (16.5%), and 82 (16.5%) were treated with first-line abiraterone acetate + prednisone, enzalutamide, and apalutamide, respectively. During the follow-up, a total of 155 (31%) were diagnosed with mCRPC with a median TTCR of 10 months. In those 155 patients, TTCR > 12 months is an independent predictor of longer OS from the first-line ARSIs. Cox regression analysis of the TTCR from initiating first-line ARSI in 496 mHSPC patients revealed three variables as independent predictors of shorter TTCR, including Gleason's score (GS) ≥ 9, the extent of disease (EOD) ≥ 2, and the presence of liver metastasis.Our results indicate that mHSPC patients with those three features are likely to have primary resistance to first-line ARSIs (doublet therapy), thus requiring consideration of other options, such as the recent triplet approach.
39466634	Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer usually have lymph nodes and bone metastasis. We present a rare case of a 51-year-old patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who complained of left truncated sciatica and diffuse bone pain and who was referred for 177Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) screening. Pretreatment 68Ga-PSMA showed left sciatic nerve and multiple bone uptake. Patient underwent stereotactic radiotherapy on the sciatic nerve metastasis (30 Gy in 6 fractions of 5 Gy) before 7.4 GBq of 177Lu-PSMA infusions. Left truncated sciatica disappeared after stereotactic radiotherapy. No additional toxicity was added to the sciatic nerve from 177Lu-PSMA after stereotactic radiotherapy.
39465866	Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has a poor prognosis especially when harboring DNA damage repair gene mutations, nevertheless, in the case of pathogenic BRCA gene mutations, PARPi demonstrated a survival benefit and is a validated treatment. Nowadays, there is no data regarding unusual metastases after these drugs. Cutaneous metastases appear rarely in prostate cancer and were associated with a worse prognosis. Moreover, there are no consolidated data concerning skin tropism of prostate cancer cells, neither in the case of BRCA-associated cancers.Here, we report the case of a patient with a long history of BRCA1-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who developed a skin lesion on the scalp while on his fifth line of systemic therapy with olaparib. After a complete radical surgical excision, the pathology report showed prostate cancer localization.A diagnosis of skin metastasis from prostate cancer was reported.The patient then continued olaparib therapy; after 7 months from excision, he experienced further bone and biochemical progression but not cutaneous progression.A literature review of all reported cases of cutaneous metastasis in prostate cancer was conducted to shed light on the incidence, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of this entity. We also reviewed published cases of skin metastasis in BRCA-associated cancers with an effort to correlate skin involvement with PARPi treatment, BRCAness status, and prognosis.
39465761	In this prospective observational study, our objective was to investigate the serum levels of Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) in prostate cancer (PCa) patients and examine its association with other serum biomarkers, and the clinical outcomes of PCa patients. This prospective observational study was conducted from January 2019 to October 2021, including 103 cases of PCa patients and 101 cases of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients who received treatment at our hospital. All patients had their serum ACSL4 levels measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before treatment. The clinical outcomes included age, body mass index, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, tumor node metastasis stage, Gleason scores, and prostate volume and serum biomarkers were collected. All patients were followed up for 36 months, the overall survival and disease-free survival were recorded for all patients. All data used SPSS 26.0 for analysis. The phosphorus (P) and serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher in PCa patients compared to BPH patients. Furthermore, compared to the BPH patients, the serum ACSL4 and free prostate-specific antigen levels were significantly decreased while serum total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) levels were significantly elevated in PCa patients. Pearson correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between ACSL4 levels and free prostate-specific antigen levels, while a negative correlation was observed with P and tPSA levels. ACSL4 might serve as a biomarker for diagnosing PCa with the AUC was 0.747, cutoff value of 33.68 ng/mL, sensitivity of 70.3%, and specificity of 60.2%. Finally, we found that ACSL4, tPSA, and P were identified as risk factors associated with PCa patients. Our findings indicated that the serum levels of ACSL4 were significantly decreased in PCa patients compared to BPH patients. Serum ACSL4 could be used as a potential biomarker for early PCa diagnosis and prognosis.
39464080	Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progresses despite androgen deprivation therapy, as cancer cells adapt to grow without testosterone, becoming more aggressive and prone to metastasis. CRPC biology complicates the development of effective therapies, posing challenges for patient care. Recent gene-expression and metabolomics studies highlight the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) as a critical player, with key components like GNPNAT1 and UAP1 being downregulated in metastatic CRPC. GNPNAT1 knockdown has been shown to increase cell proliferation and metastasis in CRPC cell lines, though the mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate the cellular basis of these CRPC phenotypes, we generated a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout model of GNPNAT1 in 22Rv1 CRPC cells, analyzing its impact on metabolomic, glycoproteomic, and transcriptomic profiles of cells. We hypothesize that HBP inhibition disrupts the cytoskeleton, altering mitotic progression and promoting uncontrolled growth. GNPNAT1 KO cells showed reduced levels of cytoskeletal filaments, such as actin and microtubules, leading to cell structure disorganization and chromosomal mis-segregation. GNPNAT1 inhibition also activated PI3K/AKT signaling, promoting proliferation, and impaired cell adhesion by mislocalizing EphB6, enhancing migration via the RhoA pathway and promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These findings suggest that HBP plays a critical role in regulating CRPC cell behavior, and targeting this pathway could provide a novel therapeutic approach.
39463621	Angiosarcoma of the bone is very rare, accounting for less than 1% of all malignant bone tumors. We report our experience with an epithelioid hemangiosarcoma arising in the proximal tibia and a review of the literature. The patient, an 85-year-old male, was referred to our institution because of left knee pain that had persisted for five months, and bone radiolucency was observed in the proximal tibia. A bone and prostate biopsy was performed due to a suspicion of prostate cancer and bone metastasis. The positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) showed accumulation in the prostate and proximal tibia, and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was high at 14.11 ng/mL. Therefore, we diagnosed the patient with bone metastasis of prostate cancer and performed curettage and cement filling. However, postoperative pathological diagnosis revealed an epithelioid hemangiosarcoma, and we considered amputation. Two months after curettage, the patient underwent transfemoral amputation because of local recurrence. Eight months after amputation, he died due to multiple metastases. Approximately 20% of cases with epithelioid hemangiosarcoma have multiple metastases at the time of initial diagnosis, and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish from bone metastases of cancer because they may be arranged in foci or on cords. There are few reports of effective adjuvant therapy, and the clinical course can be rapid, so early amputation should be considered.
39462742	For patients with low-volume de novo metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, addition of an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and prostate radiotherapy to the standard (SOC) improves survival in comparison to the next most effective strategy (SOC + ARPI). For the subgroup with prior definitive treatment of the primary tumor, long-term outcomes and genomic predictors of response to metastasis-directed therapy suggest that this might be a reasonable option in selected patients.
39459070	Prostate cancer is a disease in which cells in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system below the bladder, grow out of control and, among men, it is the second-most frequently diagnosed cancer (other than skin cancer). In recent years, prostate cancer death rate has stabilized and, currently, it is the second-most frequent cause of cancer death in men (after lung cancer). Most deaths occur due to metastasis, as cancer cells from the original tumor establish secondary tumors in distant organs. For a long time, classical cell cultures and animal models have been utilized in basic and applied scientific research, including clinical applications for many diseases, such as prostate cancer, since no better alternatives were available. Although helpful in dissecting cellular mechanisms, these models are poor predictors of physiological behavior mainly because of the lack of appropriate microenvironments. Microfluidics has emerged in the last two decades as a technology that could lead to a paradigm shift in life sciences and, in particular, controlling cancer. Microfluidic systems, such as organ-on-chips, have been assembled to mimic the critical functions of human organs. These microphysiological systems enable the long-term maintenance of cellular co-cultures in vitro to reconstitute in vivo tissue-level microenvironments, bridging the gap between traditional cell cultures and animal models. Several reviews on microfluidics for prostate cancer studies have been published focusing on technology advancement and disease progression. As metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer remains a clinically challenging late-stage cancer, with no curative treatments, we expanded this review to cover recent microfluidic applications related to prostate cancer research. The review includes discussions of the roles of microfluidics in modeling the human prostate, prostate cancer initiation and development, as well as prostate cancer detection and therapy, highlighting potentially major contributions of microfluidics in the continuous march toward eradicating prostate cancer.

39457633	"Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) presents a significant challenge in oncology due to its high mortality rate and the absence of effective biomarkers for predicting patient outcomes. Building on previous research that highlighted the critical role of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 and cell adhesion molecules in promoting tumor progression under hypoxia and estrogen stimulation, this study aimed to assess the potential of these components as prognostic biomarkers for PCa at the biopsy stage.This research utilized immunohistochemistry and droplet digital PCR to analyze formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies, focusing on specific markers within the H19/cell adhesion molecules pathway.A novel multivariate analysis led to a ""BioScore"", a composite biomarker score to predict disease progression. This score is based on evaluating five key markers: the expression levels of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 2 Alpha (HIF-2α), endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS), β4 integrin, E-cadherin transcript (CDH1), and lncRNA H19. The criteria for the ""BioScore"" involve identifying three out of these five markers, combining elevated levels of HIF-2α, eNOS, β4 integrin, and CDH1 with reduced H19 expression.This finding suggests the possibility of identifying, at the time of biopsy, PCa patients at higher risk of metastasis based on dysregulation in the H19/cell adhesion molecules circuitry. This study provides a valuable opportunity for early intervention in managing PCa, potentially contributing to personalized treatment strategies."
39457506	Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men worldwide, with metastasis, particularly to bone, being the primary cause of mortality. Currently, prognostic markers like PSA levels and Gleason classification are limited in predicting metastasis, emphasizing the need for novel clinical biomarkers. New molecules predicting tumor progression have been identified over time. Some, such as the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) PD-1/PD-L1, have become valid markers as theranostic tools essential for prognosis and drug target therapy. However, despite the success of ICIs as an anti-cancer therapy for solid tumors, their efficacy in treating bone metastases has mainly proven ineffective, suggesting intrinsic resistance to this therapy in the bone microenvironment. This study explores the potential of immunological intratumoral biomarkers, focusing on placental growth factor (PlGF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 1 (VEGFR1), and Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1), in predicting bone metastasis formation.we analyzed PCa samples from patients with and without metastasis by immunohistochemical analysis.Results revealed that PlGF expression is significantly higher in primary tumors of patients that developed metastasis within five years from the histological diagnosis. Additionally, PlGF expression correlates with increased VEGFR1 and PD-1 levels, as well as the presence of intratumoral M2 macrophages.These findings suggest that PlGF contributes to an immunosuppressive environment, thus favoring tumor progression and metastatic process. Results here highlight the potential of integrating these molecular markers with existing prognostic tools to enhance the accuracy of metastasis prediction in PCa. By identifying patients at risk for metastasis, clinicians can tailor treatment strategies more effectively, potentially improving survival outcomes and quality of life. This study underscores the importance of further research into the role of intratumoral biomarkers in PCa management.

39450704	Deleterious germline variants in certain DNA repair genes are risk factors for developing aggressive prostate cancer. The objective was to quantify their prognostic impact after prostate cancer diagnosis.Men with prostate cancer, predominantly of European ancestry, were included from four cohorts with long-term follow-up. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in 26 DNA repair genes were assessed in relation to metastasis-free survival in high-risk, localized prostate cancer and to overall survival in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).Among 3,525 patients initially diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer, 2,594 had high-risk localized prostate cancer, 429 mCSPC, and 502 mCRPC at inclusion. BRCA2 variant carriers did not have worse metastasis-free survival in high-risk localized prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69, 1.46) or overall survival in mCSPC (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.14, 1.45) or mCRPC (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31, 1.17) compared to non-carriers of DNA repair variants. Among 868 additional patients with de novo metastatic (M1) prostate cancer, BRCA2 variant carriers tended to have worse overall survival (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.01, 2.51). BRCA2 prognostic associations were not explained by radiation, PARP inhibitor, or platinum therapy. Results for other genes were limited in precision because variants were less common.Among patients with high-risk or metastatic prostate cancer who were initially diagnosed with and treated for non-metastatic tumors, germline DNA repair variants in BRCA2 do not confer a substantially worse prognosis.
39447880	To assess 5-year oncologic outcomes following primary partial gland cryo-ablation (PPGCA) in intermediate risk prostate cancer.Of 476 men undergoing PPGCA enrolled in our prospective oncologic and functional outcomes study, 313 had MRI concordant intermediate risk prostate cancer with no out-of-field Gleason Grade Group (GGG) ≥2, gross extracapsular extension or extreme apical disease on pre-treatment mpMRI. PSA was monitored every 6 months, and mpMRI at 6-12, 24, 42 and 60 months. Protocol biopsy at 6-12 months and 24 months were discontinued after interim analysis showing low rates of clinically-significant prostate cancer (csPCa) defined as any GGG≥2 disease. Freedom-from-failure (FFF) was defined as no prostate cancer specific mortality, metastatic disease, or whole-gland salvage treatment (WGST) RESULTS: csPCa was detected in 33 (10.5%) subjects. 91 had ≥4.5 years of follow-up data with a mean of 8.9, 3.4, and 2.0 surveillance PSA tests, MRIs, and prostate biopsies; none were lost to follow-up. At 5-years, rates of freedom-from-recurrence of in-field, out-of-field and overall csPCa were 86% (95% CI: 78-96), 85% (95% CI: 63-94), and 70% (95% CI: 57-84). The proportion with freedom-from-failure (FFF) at 5 years was 89% (95% CI: 83-95). None died from prostate cancer, 1 (1%) developed metastasis, 15 (16.5%) underwent WGST, and 15 (16.5%) underwent salvage focal therapy (FT). Only 3 of 91 (3.3%) eligible men were noncompliant with 5-year surveillance protocol.Very encouraging intermediate-term oncological outcomes following PPGCA were observed with very high compliance to a rigorous prospective protocol for identifying recurrent csPCa.
